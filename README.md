# Software-Engineering-Project

We have undertaken the development of an innovative mobile application aimed at
revolutionizing the accessibility and independence of visually impaired individuals.We aims to create a platform that harnesses the
power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to empower blind users with real-time
visual information.
Through extensive user research and feedback from the visually impaired community, we have
established the following objectives for our project:

● Enable visually impaired users to capture images and videos using their mobile devices.
● Implement a robust ML-powered visual chatbot system that can accurately describe and
interpret the content of captured images and videos.
● Transform the chatbot's responses into clear and comprehensible audio signals for the
user.
● Facilitate an interactive and intuitive chatbot interface that allows users to ask questions
and seek information related to the captured visual content.
● Ensure seamless integration with assistive technologies and accessibility features on
various mobile platforms.
● Enhance the user's daily life by providing them with timely and relevant visual
information, fostering independence, and improving overall quality of life.

Our mobile application, designed with user-centric principles, will not only bridge the
accessibility gap but also open new opportunities for visually impaired individuals to explore
and interact with the visual world around them. By harnessing the potential of AI and machine
learning, we aim to provide a transformative tool that empowers blind users to navigate and
comprehend the visual aspects of their daily lives.
